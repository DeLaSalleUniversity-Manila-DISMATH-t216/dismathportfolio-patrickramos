##Quotes I learned from class:

> _"Everything happens for a reason."_


> _"Yesterday is history, Tomorrow is a mystery, Today is a gift that's why it's called present."_


> _"Whether you think you can, or think you can't, you're right."_


> _"The only way to predict the future is to create it."_


> _"Sometimes in life, you need to make a choice that can risk and abandon your other choice."_



##Week 1:

- I learned the various expression of conditional statement
  - if p, then q
  - if p, q
  - p is suffiecient for q
  - q if p
  - q when p
  - p implies q
  - p only if q
  - a sufficient condition for q is p
  
- I learned that in logic circuits counting from 0-3 in binary is the basic combinations in truth table which is
 00,01,10,11 where 0 is logic false and 1 is logic true
  
- I mastered the truth table for Conjunction, Disjunction, Exclusive OR, Conditional, and Biconditional

| Logical Symbol  |  Logical Connective | Usage |
| :-----: |:-------:|:-----:|
| ¬ |Negation | not |
| ∧ | Conjunction | and |
| ∨ | Disjunction | or |
| ⊕ | Exclusive disjunction | xor | 
| → | Conditional | if, then & only if|
| ⇔| Biconditional | iff |


##Week 2:

- I learned about the quantifiers which are the predicate and the nested
  - ∃xP(x) - there exist
  - ∀xP(x) - for all

- I learned and memorized some of the laws that are commonly used in proving

| Logical Equivalence  |  |  |
| :-----: |:-------:|:-----:|
| Commutative | p ∧ q ⇐⇒ q ∧ p |  p ∨ q ⇐⇒ q ∨ p |
| Associative | (p ∧ q) ∧ r ⇐⇒ p ∧ (q ∧ r) | (p ∨ q) ∨ r ⇐⇒ p ∨ (q ∨ r) |
| Distributive | p ∧ (q ∨ r) ⇐⇒ (p ∧ q) ∨ (p ∧ r) | p ∨ (q ∧ r) ⇐⇒ (p ∨ q) ∧ (p ∨ r) |
| Identity | p ∧ T ⇐⇒ p | p ∨ F ⇐⇒ p |
| Negation | p∨ ∼ p ⇐⇒ T | p∧ ∼ p ⇐⇒ F |
| Double Negative | ∼ (∼ p) ⇐⇒ p |
| Idempotent | p ∧ p ⇐⇒ p | p ∨ p ⇐⇒ p |
| Universal Bound | p ∨ T ⇐⇒ T | p ∧ F ⇐⇒ F |
| De Morgan’s | ∼ (p ∧ q) ⇐⇒ (∼ p) ∨ (∼ q)  | ∼ (p ∨ q) ⇐⇒ (∼ p) ∧ (∼ q) |
| Absorption | p ∨ (p ∧ q) ⇐⇒ p | p ∧ (p ∨ q) ⇐⇒ p |
| Conditional | (p ⇒ q) ⇐⇒ (∼ p ∨ q) | ∼ (p ⇒ q) ⇐⇒ (p∧ ∼ q) |


##Week 3:

- I learned about the Rules of Inference
  - argument
  - valid
  - fallacy
  
- I learned about the different types of proofs
  - Direct Proof
    - (assume p is true, show that q is also true)
  - Proof by Contraposition
    - (not q as hypothesis, not p must follow)
  - Vacuous Proof
    - (p is false, because p implying q must be true when p is false)
  - Trivial Proof
    - (show that q is true, because p implies q)
  - Proof by Contradiction
    - (assume not p is true, show that 1 ends up in a contradiction)
  - Proof by Equivalence
    - (show that p impyling q and q implying p is true)

##Week 4:

- I learned how to use counterexamples and apply then in proving.

- Mathematical Induction:
  - First Step: Substitution (Basis)
  - Second Step: Direct Proof (Inductive)

- I learned the importance of Summation which is basically providing the equation for a pattern.
- I also learned the function of Recursive and its algorithm.

##Week 5:

- This week we continued the discussion about summation and recursion. I learned different problems involving logic behind some basic principles of recursive, series, factorial and others.
- Geometric Series, Power Series are important lessons that are taught.
- It is also introduced the use of Hoare Triple in which there are 3 main parts. There is an initial assertion then the program segment and lastly the final assertion.

##Week 6:

- I learned about sets and its definition.
- I also learned common misconceptions about sets and some of its equality equations.
- Functions are also introduced in this week.
  - One-to-one Function (Injective)
  - Onto Function (Surjective)
  - One-to-one Correspondence (Bijection)

##Week 7:

- I learned graphs of functions by self studying it.
- I learned Introduction to Algorithm.
  - Finding the maximum
  - Finding the minimum
  - Pseudocodes
  - Precondition and Postcondition
  - Properties
- I learned Linear Search and Binary Search Algorithms


##Week 8:


- I learned Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort but I quite find this difficult to understand.
- I learned Growth of Functions
  - Big O
  - Big Omega
  - Big Theta
  - Time Complexity


| Big O Complexity  |
| :-----: |
| O(1) |
| O(log n) |
| O(n) |
| O(n log n) | 
| O(n^2) |
| O(2^n) |
| O(n!) |

##Week 9:

- I learned Graphs, Graphs Theory and its Introduction
- I learned what is a degree, a vertex, a subgraph, a path and a circuit.

- Euler Circuit, Euler Path
- It is a circuit if all nodes have even degree
- It is a path when exactly 2 vertices have odd degree.

- I learned how to use the Handshaking Theorem
- I learned Matrices of Graphs

- Hamilton Circuit, Hamilton Path
- It is a Hamilton Circuit if you pass all the nodes in a graph then end up on where you started.
- It is a Path by just checking and redrawing it in your imagination if it will pass all the nodes in the graph even though you will not end up on your starting pointl

- I learned how to distinguish wether the graph is Isomorphic or Planar
- Euler's Formula : r = e - v + 2 where r are the regions, e are the edges, and v are the vertices.

- Kuratowski's Theorem states that when the 2 graphs presented are a subgraph of the graph given then it is non-planar.


##Week 10:

- I learned about Graph Coloring or the 4 color theorem
  - Planar graphs have maximum of 4 colors
  - Non planar graphs can have as many colors as they want.
- I learned about Trees
  - Order rooted trees
  - Properties of trees
  - Binary Search Tree
  - Forest - a group of trees
  - Lemma - any tree with at least 1 edge must have at least one vertex of degree 1
  - Parts of Trees: root, parent, child, ancestors, descendants
  - M-ary Tree
- I also learned about Modeling Computation
- Automata Theory and Finite State Machines
- State diagrams, State tables
- Grammar and Language is also an important lesson in Dismath
- Vending Machine application and the process inside it
