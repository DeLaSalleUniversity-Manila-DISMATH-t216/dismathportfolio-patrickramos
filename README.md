##Week 1:

- I learned the various expression of conditional statement
  - if p, then q
  - if p, q
  - p is suffiecient for q
  - q if p
  - q when p
  - p implies q
  - p only if q
  - a sufficient condition for q is p
  
- I learned that in logic circuits counting from 0-3 in binary is the basic combinations in truth table which is
 00,01,10,11 where 0 is logic false and 1 is logic true
  
- I mastered the truth table for Conjunction, Disjunction, Exclusive OR, Conditional, and Biconditional

| Logical Symbol  |  Logical Connective | Usage |
| :-----: |:-------:|:-----:|
| ¬ |Negation | not |
| ∧ | Conjunction | and |
| ∨ | Disjunction | or |
| ⊕ | Exclusive disjunction | xor | 
| → | Conditional | if, then & only if|
| ⇔| Biconditional | iff |


##Week 2:

- I learned about the quantifiers which are the predicate and the nested
  - ∃xP(x) - there exist
  - ∀xP(x) - for all

- I learned and memorized some of the laws that are commonly used in proving

| Logical Equivalence  |  |  |
| :-----: |:-------:|:-----:|
| Commutative | p ∧ q ⇐⇒ q ∧ p |  p ∨ q ⇐⇒ q ∨ p |
| Associative | (p ∧ q) ∧ r ⇐⇒ p ∧ (q ∧ r) | (p ∨ q) ∨ r ⇐⇒ p ∨ (q ∨ r) |
| Distributive | p ∧ (q ∨ r) ⇐⇒ (p ∧ q) ∨ (p ∧ r) | p ∨ (q ∧ r) ⇐⇒ (p ∨ q) ∧ (p ∨ r) |
| Identity | p ∧ T ⇐⇒ p | p ∨ F ⇐⇒ p |
| Negation | p∨ ∼ p ⇐⇒ T | p∧ ∼ p ⇐⇒ F |
| Double Negative | ∼ (∼ p) ⇐⇒ p |
| Idempotent | p ∧ p ⇐⇒ p | p ∨ p ⇐⇒ p |
| Universal Bound | p ∨ T ⇐⇒ T | p ∧ F ⇐⇒ F |
| De Morgan’s | ∼ (p ∧ q) ⇐⇒ (∼ p) ∨ (∼ q)  | ∼ (p ∨ q) ⇐⇒ (∼ p) ∧ (∼ q) |
| Absorption | p ∨ (p ∧ q) ⇐⇒ p | p ∧ (p ∨ q) ⇐⇒ p |
| Conditional | (p ⇒ q) ⇐⇒ (∼ p ∨ q) | ∼ (p ⇒ q) ⇐⇒ (p∧ ∼ q) |


##Week 3:

- I learned about the Rules of Inference
  - argument
  - valid
  - fallacy
  
- I learned about the different types of proofs
  - Direct Proof
    - (assume p is true, show that q is also true)
  - Proof by Contraposition
    - (not q as hypothesis, not p must follow)
  - Vacuous Proof
    - (p is false, because p implying q must be true when p is false)
  - Trivial Proof
    - (show that q is true, because p implies q)
  - Proof by Contradiction
    - (assume not p is true, show that 1 ends up in a contradiction)
  - Proof by Equivalence
    - (show that p impyling q and q implying p is true)

##Week 4:

- I learned how to use counterexamples and apply then in proving.

- Mathematical Induction:
  - First Step: Substitution (Basis)
  - Second Step: Direct Proof (Inductive)

- I learned the importance of Summation which is basically providing the equation for a pattern.
- I also learned the function of Recursive and its algorithm.
